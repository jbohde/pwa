# M.U.T.E.

## Description

M.U.T.E (Minorly Unique Text Editor) is a text editor that runs in the browser. It is a PWA (progressive web application) that features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline. You can take notes that standout with JavaScript syntax highlighting.
